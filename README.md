# Duplicate-File-Finder
Program to identify duplicate files on a hard drive

This is a work in progress program to identify files that are duplicates in content in different folders within a hard drive, or between two different drives.  It calculates the SHA1 hash of each file in parallel, and uses those hashes to find any occurance of duplication.

The process has a very long running time, so future improvements will likely be focused on 1) Removing unnecessary steps, and 2) Improving the user interface.
